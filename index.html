						<p>
							I am a young mother to two wonderful boys. I am married to a Levan native and my best friend, Caleb. I am a small business owner. I am a proud citizen of Nephi, Utah. <!-- I also work with a small business owner and help him to run his business more efficiently and grow his business while continueing to provide excellent service.-->

							<h2>My Platform</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							The best quality I bring to the City Council is my strong voice. I am not afraid to stand up for what is right even if I must stand alone. I am not afraid to say what needs to be said even if some may consider it offensive that I disagree with them. I will not simply vote to move things along, but I will carefully consider all matters brought before me, and I will vote for what is best for all citizens of Nephi. I will represent young families, citizens who just moved in, and those who love our small town just the way it is. I want to keep Nephiâ€™s small-town community and the benefits that come with that while doing what is best for all citizens of Nephi. 
						</p>
						<!--If you want a strong voice on the Nephi City Council 
						then vote for Vanessa Goates on or before September 5, 2023.
						-->
						<p>
							I have attended city council regularly since I moved to Nephi in April of 2021. I have noticed that it is rare to see members of the council disagree with or even question those who present them with information. I do not think disagreeing has value in itself, but I think several members of our city council are too passive. We need representatives that will carefully consider, learn about, and have an opinion on matters brought before them. 
						</p>
						<!--- <p>
							We are not guaranteed exemption from the corruption happening throughout our country. It is important to know what is going on in our city but it is not enough. If we are going to insulate ourselves from the corruption happening throughout our country we need representatives who are informed on local as well as national matters.
